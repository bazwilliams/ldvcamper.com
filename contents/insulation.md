We recycled insulation from various sources including materials from a garage conversion and the caravan, and we purchased some acoustic material for the roof of the van, this was fitted between the braces and fiberglass roof. The van already had a plywood floor, we added a layer of rubber for additional insulation and noise proofing. Because this work was being done whilst the van was insured as a 'Panel Van', we could not cut the windows, so the wallboard was precut where the windows should be and they would be cut out of the van later.
