We started wallboarding the van whilst it was still insured as a 'Panel Van', this meant we could not cut holes until we'd changed the insurance to a self build motorhome type. However, we could install the roof vents, we opted to recycle one from the caravan (MPK) to be used in the bathroom and purchased a new Fiamma one to be install in the living area.
