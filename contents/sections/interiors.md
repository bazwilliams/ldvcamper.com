title: Furniture Modification

We reused the furniture from the van, however it would never be a straight swap so modifications were required, the kitchen unit was altered so it was flush (originally the fridge, sink  and hob were recessed slightly.

We halved one of the bench seats to make two seats facing each other. They were positioned at a distance to allow the table we purchased to fit in between which in future would form part of the bed.

The aisle between the kitchen and dining area, it needs to be wide enough for 2 people to walk past each other, yet small enough to allow a bed to be extend across easily.

There is a minimum distance between gas burners on a hob and combustible materials, since the wallboard is combustible we installed a splashback. This is aluminium and was purchased from IKEA, it is actually a safety frame to stop children from reaching pots on a hob, but we found we could reverse it easily and attach it directly to the wall.
