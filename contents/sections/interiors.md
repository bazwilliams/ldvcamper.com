We reused the furniture from the van, however it would never be a straight swap so modifications were required, the kitchen unit was altered so it was flush (originally the fridge, sink  and hob were recessed slightly.

We halved one of the bench seats to make two seats facing each other. They were positioned at a distance to allow the table we purchased to fit in between which in future would form part of the bed.

The aisle between the kitchen and dining area, it needs to be wide enough for 2 people to walk past each other, yet small enough to allow a bed to be extend across easily.

The bathroom was recovered in entirety from the donor caravan. The shape and size of the LDV bathroom was dictated by the caravan's shower base. To save some space we opted to install the cartridge toilet within the shower base, this required a small cutout to be made in the shower base side to accommodate the cartridge removal. The sink would be above the toilet.

To begin with we took the bathroom door from the caravan and resized it to fit over the new bathroom door. On the first night we realised it collided with the bed out so we couldn't get into the bathroom when the bed was down! We therefore opted for a bifolding door, we sliced the door in two and ordered some plastic mirrors from a local company (Q D plastics) which we stuck to the bifold doors with Sikaflex. The back of the doors were rebuilt using the bathroom wallboard material rather than the original wood effect. We purchased new handles re place all the cupboard door handles, one was attached to the bathroom door for consistency throughout the van. We found the mirrors warped in heat when we holidayed in Spain, so these were later reattached inside a wooden frame so they could expand and contract. Additionally white PVC plastic was fitted around the two bifolds.

From the design we had decided how many and what size cushions we require. Luckily the foam from the cushions in the donor caravan was still in good shape we reused it along with the wadding covering them. That way we only needed to make new covers, we purchased fabric from eBay and zips from a local haberdashery. Louise's mum then manufactured the cushion covers for us which we slipped over the cut down caravan cushions. Longer term we could replace the foam and reuse the cushion covers.

The cab area had a double seat on the passenger side which we felt could be replaced with a single seat to provide more room for getting in and out of the back. Later we'd plan to replace both seats with swivelling versions. We found an LDV driver seat online with the same upholstery, we then ordered some brackets from LDV to attach it. Holes exist in the floor for left hand drive fitting. We then installed a wood skirting board between the cab and living area with an aluminium divider to fill the gap between the cab rubber mat and the living area linoleum.

The blind was reasonably straight forward to fit because we didn't need to cut it down, however because of the window ledge we needed to trim the runner catch at the bottom and remove the handle from the fly screen.

Finally we opted to dress the window surround with in the same fabric as the seats.

There is a minimum distance between gas burners on a hob and combustible materials, since the wallboard is combustible we installed a splashback. This is aluminium and was purchased from IKEA, it is actually a safety frame to stop children from reaching pots on a hob, but we found we could reverse it easily and attach it directly to the wall.
