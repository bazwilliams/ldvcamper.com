We started wallboarding the van whilst it was still insured as a 'Panel Van', this meant we could not cut holes until we'd changed the insurance to a self build motorhome type. However, we could install the roof vents, we opted to recycle one from the caravan (MPK) to be used in the bathroom and purchased a new Fiamma one to be install in the living area.

One evening in Spain we found the van was very warm inside and colder outside. We left the door open slightly to get some of the 'cold' outside air in the van by blowing it in with some 12v fans. We investigated replacing the skylight with an omnivent type fitting, but in the end we opted for 2 computer fans mounted on an aluminium frame inside the skylight. These fans are set to exhaust the air out of the roof vent. We looked around for the least noisy fans we could find, these are Nexus computer fans. For the moment they are both set to maximum speed however they are PWM fans so we could control the speed using a PWM signal should we decide we want to lower the speed for overnight use. They are much quieter than the 12v fans we used beforehand!
