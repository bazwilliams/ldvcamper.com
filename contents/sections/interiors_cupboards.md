All caravans/campers need storage space and we although not fitted at first, we had planned overhead cupboards.

We salvaged the cupboards from the caravan and refitted with our preferred handles. 

There is a plastic shelf above the driver cab which housed the charging unit taken from the caravan, to the right of this unit we have installed white hardboard base and sides and the ceiling board curving to the front. This brightens up the overcab, storage area and will form a cupboard to store towels and blankets. This is ideal, because we have used the existing frame of the shelf for strength, but hidden it with nicer looking materials. Once finished, this gave a height measurement for the planned over-kitchen and over-seat cupboards. 

The facia was some wardrobe backing purchased from the bargain corner section of IKEA for Â£1 each which matched our furniture colour very well. 

The left of this cupboard has since had the Zig unit removed, and replaced with a blank facia, however it still houses all the wiring behind and inside this cupboard now resides the fuse box for all the electrical wiring (documented later).

The over kitchen cupboard is basically the frame from the caravan's cupboard modified and screwed to a base also extracted from the caravan. The underside was fitted with a piece of aluminium. Without this, the interior of the cupboard got very warm when cooking or boiling the kettle! The IKEA backing was used to face this cupboard. 

A later modification/afterthought was to fit an LED light, we were able to drop a cable behind the wallboard from cupboard to the light and run this at the back of the cupboard, we purchased a piece of plastic strip to hide the cable which was routed via the bathroom. 

For strength, these are screwed and glued onto the wall at the back, the bathroom wall and ceiling. We found the metal ribs in the van roof and screwed the frame into these making it very sturdy.

The cupboard over the dinette needed to be the height of the over cab cupboard so it gave the appearance of wrapping around that corner, it also needed to be deep enough to hide the new solar panel fitted to the roof and wide enough to fit between the wardrobe and the cab. Once measurements and heights were known, the frame was manufactured from existing caravan cupboard frames with additional framework to support the increased width and depth. It was again faced with the IKEA wardrobe backing and fitted with the cupboards from the caravan and new handles. The floor of the cupboard was a carefully cut piece of white hardboard which had to follow each curve of the van. The cupboard was also attached to the roof ribs and side walls with screws and much sikaflex. Within the floor of this cupboard we fitted 3 LED downlights switched at the end. One switch controls the central light and one switch controls the two outer lights.
