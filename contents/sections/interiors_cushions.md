From the design we had decided how many and what size cushions we require. 

<div class="flickrslideshow" data-ids="[6869288837, 6869288175, 6869288083, 6869288001, 13723531843]">

Luckily the foam from the cushions in the donor caravan was still in good shape we reused it along with the wadding covering them. That way we only needed to make new covers, we purchased fabric from eBay and zips from a local haberdashery. Louise's mum then manufactured the cushion covers for us from the upholstery fabric which we slipped over the cut down caravan cushions. Longer term we could replace the foam and reuse the cushion covers.
