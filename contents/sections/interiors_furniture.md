title: Furniture Modification
---

We reused the furniture from the van, however it would never be a straight swap so modifications were required. 

The kitchen unit from the caravan fitted perfectly length ways, but we had to cut down the width and make it flush (originally the fridge, sink  and hob were recessed slightly). We didn't want to buy a brand new worktop because we felt it may get damaged during the build, so we obtained a scrap wardrobe from IKEA and cut one of the sides to size. The unit has been designed to allow the worktop to be removed and replaced after it has been installed.

We wanted a large bed to comfortably accomodate two adults with a decent length. To fit the original requirements of a fixed table you could sit around we designed a system which could be a bench seat, a central table and two single chairs facing each other along with a fully flat bed. 

We halved one of the bench seats from the caravan to make two seats facing each other. They were positioned at a distance to allow the table we purchased to fit in between which in future would form part of the bed.

The aisle between the kitchen and dining area needed to be wide enough for 2 people to walk past each other, yet small enough to allow a bed to be extend across easily.

There is a minimum distance between gas burners on a hob and combustible materials, since the wallboard is combustible we installed a splashback. This is aluminium and was purchased from IKEA, it is actually a safety frame to stop children from reaching pots on a hob, but we found we could reverse it easily and attach it directly to the wall.

Here is the plan for the replacement bed, this was designed after 2 years usage of the previous (temporary) system. We specifically tackled the problematic and inconvenient features of the old style one.
