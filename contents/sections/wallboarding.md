We then refitted the plywood originally fitted to the side walls and glued our new wallboard to this. Battens were installed near the roof so the wallboard could be fixed  at the roof.

 *** Internal Partitioning ***
 
 We purchased some thin wood to sandwich between wallboards to construct partition walls for the wardrobe and bathroom. The bathroom was sized to match the shower basin we recycled from the caravan and the wardrobe sized to match the available room ensuring one of the caravan cupboard doors could be used. We used thicker wood to form a more solid wall between the rear doors and the bathroom.
