We found a company called 'NoiseKiller Acoustics' which offered sound proofing kits for a variety of vans and 4x4s, we found the LDV noise loud and after reading some reviews online we opted to purchase a kit. It did make a significant improvement as we could hear each other easily when talking to someone in the back whilst driving on the motorway! Unfortunately it didn't quite fit the bonnet, presumably their template was from a different type of LDV, but it didn't take long with a pair of scissors to fit!
