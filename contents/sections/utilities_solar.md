Since we wanted everything to run using 12v in the back, we felt we could use a Solar panel which could allow us to wildcamp or stay without electric hookup at campsites for longer. We purchased a 60W monocrystlline panel and fitted it to the roof. We purchased aluminium brackets to fit it flush with a gap between the panel and the roof. I drilled a hole in the roof and sikaflexed the cable using a grommit. The panel came with a cheap solar regulator to charge a leisure battery which we shall be replacing shortly with an MPPT version (probably a Tracer MPPT regulator). 

The negative of the panel is hooked directly into the regulator and the positive is routed through a relay. This relay switches off the solar panel if the split relay circuit is active. 

The regulator is then connected directly to the battery via a 7.5A fuse. 

The solar regulator manual specifically stated we shouldn't use it when another charger was running which is why a relay is in use to deactivate the panel when our TEC3M detects the van battery is being charged.
