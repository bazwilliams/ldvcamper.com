Since we wanted everything to run using 12v in the back, we felt we could use a Solar panel which could allow us to wildcamp or stay without electric hookup at campsites for longer. We purchased a 60W monocrystalline panel and fitted it to the roof. We purchased aluminium brackets to fit it flush with a gap between the panel and the roof. These were pop rivetted to the fibre glass roof with sikaflex to both seal and stick the brackets to the roof.

I drilled a hole in the roof and sikaflexed the cable using a grommet and works fine. However, in hindsight, I'd have rather used a cable entry gland as the cable would have been better managed.

The panel came with a low cost Phocus PWM solar regulator to charge a leisure battery which we used for a few years before replacing with a 10A/12V MPPT Tracer regulator. 

The negative of the panel is hooked directly into the regulator and the positive is routed through a relay. This relay switches off the solar panel if the split relay circuit is active. 

The regulator is then connected directly to the battery via a 7.5A fuse. 

The Phocus' solar regulator manual specifically stated we shouldn't have it connected when another charger was running which is why a relay is in use to deactivate the panel when our TEC3M detects the van battery is being charged.
