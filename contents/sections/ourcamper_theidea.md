Barry put his skills to work and planned out a couple of simple layouts on 3D Max (a CAD/3D Graphics application). Louise's dad cut out scale models of the van and caravan furniture. This allowed us to move the furniture around to see what was feasible. Both of these planning methods allowed us to rule out a number of layouts.

We moved the furniture around and came up with 2 possible layouts, 1 keeping the back door usable and another blocking off the doors with the bathroom/wardrobe. Eventually we opted for closing off the backdoors for a few reasons; first it saved "dressing up" the inside of the doors; second it allowed us a "work" area for the gas bottles, toilet, tools and other stuff we didn't want inside the living area. This we thought was a much better option than being able to use the back doors as a loading bay (it's a camper, not a van).

Barry then continued with the 3D max version by modeling the virtual van accurately in terms of height and shape and building the layouts we'd chosen. We scanned and downloaded swatches of fabrics and wallboards to help decide what would look best before we purchased the materials.
