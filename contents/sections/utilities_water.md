We wanted a hot water supply as well as cold, so took advantage of the carver heater extracted from the caravan. We used the 3D Max plans to decide the best size and position for the fresh and waste water tanks (to be ordered from C.A.K. tanks) and the route and length of water pipes. C.A.K. were very helpful as they added necessary outlets to the tanks for us and included all the necesary water pipe fittings and pipes in the order. The water tank was fitted with an attachment so it could be used with a submersible pump.

We originally wanted to use the supplementary side hatch on the van to access the water tank so it could be filled from outside.  But this never happened, there was not enough access through the narrow opening between the floor and top of the seat to make it worthwhile.

The waste water tank was installed under the chassis, whilst we'd purchased a kit to do this and measured the tank to fit within chassis bars, a bracket was required to be which Louise's Dad manufactured for us.

The fresh water tank was positioned inplace next to the hatch, but when the seat was installed, we realised there was not enough available space between the top of the tank and seat to fill the tank from the outside. We modified the seat so it could be filled temporarily from the inside and an exterior filling option was added to the list of future tasks. The water pipes were routed as planned first into the water heater, then bathroom and filing kitchen sink. The bathroom required a few spurs for the sink taps and shower. The water pipes were routed under the van from the water heater to the bathroom as this was the easiest way around the gas box, all of these outdoor pipes were insulated using foam jackets where possible.

We installed another inlet to the water tank and an exterior filling cap, we drilled the outside of the van and fixed the filling cap, we didn't want to fit the filler cap on the hatch door so decided to fit it further along, it needed to be low enough so the tubing on the inside could be boxed in, yet high enough to provide an effective flow to the tank. C.A.K. supplied the new tank inlet, tubing and filling cap. The inlet was straight forward to attach to the tank requiring a hole to be drilled and screwed into place, having the tank contain an access hatch was imperative to screwing the inlet into position as it required internal access... The air vent on the tank was attached to the filler cap to provide a water tight seal in the event of over filling.

After a few years when we replaced the bathroom, the tap unit that came with the sink we purchased was not microswitched meaning we couldn't use it with the submersible pump. We purchased a replacement tap which unfortunately conflicted with the top of the raised sink, we then decided to refit the old tap and upgrade the water supply to a pressurised system using a Shurflo Trailking pump. The newly purchased tap was used to replace the old Avondale tap in the kitchen. This meant I could strip out a lot of redundant microswitch wiring too! Because the sink was being moved the older water pipes were removed and replaced with a straight feed to the kitchen taps. The pipes under the van were then split and a cold and water spur routed through the old shower trap hole into the new sink cabinet. This pump has a sensor which detects if the pressure drops and starts up, this would happen if a tap is opened, but could also happen if a water pipe bursts or is loose. This would result in all our water being pumped into the van and potentially the motor running dry. We fitted an isolator switch to cut power to the pump when we're not using it to avoid this.

A year later we then added a water gauge to the tank through the same hole the original sub pump was fitted, we measured the depth of the tank and cut the three metal sensor prongs to match 3/4 full, 1/2 full and 1/4 full screwed it into the widened hole and sikaflexed it in place. The indicator panel was fitted next to the pump isolator switch in the over cab cupboard.
