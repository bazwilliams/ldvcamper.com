The cab area originally had a double seat on the passenger side which we felt could be replaced with a single seat to provide more room for getting in and out of the back. Later we'd planned to replace both seats with swivelling versions. We found an LDV driver seat online with the same upholstery, we then ordered some brackets from LDV to attach it. Holes exist in the floor for left hand drive fitting. We then installed a wood skirting board between the cab and living area with an aluminium divider to fill the gap between the cab rubber mat and the living area linoleum.

We eventually decided to replace the two LDV seats with more comfortable swivelling seats. We had a good look around at captain chairs and swivel plates, but in the end settled for a pair removed from a Ford Galaxy which were in great condition and being sold at an excellent price. I did some research online and found that people were installing these on T4 bases, since a lot of people stated this I assumed they were right and sought out a pair of T4 bases. When I got them home, I realised I was wrong - the Ford Galaxy seats do not fit the T4 bases directly. The Galaxy seats are slightly narrower than the holes in the base and longer by about 25mm. Louise's Dad fabricated a new set of seat bases from these T4 bases to fit the Galaxy seats. Additionally, since the height of the T4 bases plus the height of the Galaxy seats would be too high, they were cut down. An angle was incorporated to simulate the driving position of the LDV seats we were replacing.

We wanted to store the outdoor gear in the back of van accessible through the back doors, this would be the water filling and waste pipes; electric hookup cables; the gas bottles; camping chairs; tables and any other outdoor equipment. Also accessible from within the back doors is the cartridge toilet and flush access.
