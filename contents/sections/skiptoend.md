The rest of this website shows the various planning stages, any problems we encountered and resolved and all important pictures documenting the build.

We applied to have the V5 body type updated from 'Panel Van' to 'Motor Caravan' in May 2009, we were requested to present the van for inspection at the VOSA site in Bishopbriggs. We passed the inspection and the V5 was sent to us a few weeks later with an updated body type.

The photographs below show the van in one of its incarnations of completeness - after all a camper conversion is never complete. Some of these photographs were used for valuation purposes by our self build motorhome insurer.
