Once the van was reinsured as a self build motorhome conversion we started cutting holes in the side of the van. We reused the rectangular windows from the Avondale donor caravan; the medium sized caravan galley window was to be installed in the dinette and the small caravan bathroom window to be installed on the side door. The caravan front window was too large and front side windows were oddly shaped to be useful, however we recovered many of the fittings as spare parts. The rubber seal for the windows was reused, but we purchased new white tape to fit inside the black seal.

The gap between the interior wallboard and the dinette window was significant, so we opted to install a Remis blind in the dinette. We filled the cavity with carefully cut wood and installed some wallboard to act as a ledge, we then dressed the edge of the wallboard with white PVC angle.

The blind was reasonably straight forward to fit because we didn't need to cut it down, however because of the window ledge we needed to trim the runner catch at the bottom and remove the handle from the fly screen.

Finally we opted to dress the window surround with in the same fabric as the seats.
