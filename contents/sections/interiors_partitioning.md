Once we had put up all of the wall boards and ceiling board it was time to partition the van into separate areas. 

The bathroom shower base fitted perfectly between the back door and wheel arch, it even had an indentation where the diesel filling pipe was situated. It was as if it was made for it.

Combined with the fixed size shower based extracted from the caravan, we had the measurements needed to define the modifications required for the kitchen unit and the wardrobe location. Originally we planned to have a half height wardrobe above the gas bottles at the back giving some floor space in front. This was shelved in favour of pulling the wardrobe behind the chair giving a full height version conveniently hiding the wheel arch (where a set of drawers were originally planned to fit). This would give us more room for essential storage!

When installing the seats we had to make sure the fresh water container would fit under one seat and that the gas water heater would fit under the other as we didn't want the fresh water tank outside the living area. Louise's dad cut down the caravan seat and made up additional supports for bench mode and bed mode. 

We needed to use the van before deciding how to finish the bathroom door, so we installed the one used from the caravan, unfortunately this was a little too big and made it impossible to open when the bed was down. Over the winter we had the bathroom door trimmed and cut into two halves and hinged them together to make a bi-fold door. The door looked quite bland so we decided to put mirrored acrylic plastic on each side.

We purchased some thin wood to sandwich between wallboards to construct partition walls for the wardrobe and bathroom. The bathroom was sized to match the shower basin we recycled from the caravan and the wardrobe sized to match the available room ensuring one of the caravan cupboard doors could be used. We used thicker wood to form a more solid wall between the rear doors and the bathroom.
