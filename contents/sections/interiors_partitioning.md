Once we had put up all of the wall boards and ceiling board it was time to partition the van into separate areas. 

The bathroom shower base fitted perfectly between the back door and wheel arch, it even had an indentation where the diesel filling pipe was situated. It was as if it was made for it.

Combined with the fixed size shower based extracted from the caravan, we had the measurements needed to define the modifications required for the kitchen unit and the wardrobe location. Originally we planned to have a half height wardrobe above the gas bottles at the back giving some floor space in front. This was shelved in favour of pulling the wardrobe behind the chair giving a full height version conveniently hiding the wheel arch (where a set of drawers were originally planned to fit). This would give us more room for essential storage!

When installing the seats we had to make sure the fresh water container would fit under one seat and that the gas water heater would fit under the other as we didn't want the fresh water tank outside the living area. Louise's dad cut down the caravan seat and made up additional supports for bench mode and bed mode. 


We needed to use the van before deciding how to finish the bathroom door so to begin with we took the bathroom door from the caravan and resized it to fit over the new bathroom door. On the first night we realised it collided with the bed out so we couldn't get into the bathroom when the bed was down! 

We therefore opted for a bifolding door. The door looked quite bland so we decided to fit mirrored acrylic plastic on each side.

Over the winter we had the bathroom door trimmed and cut into two halves and hinged them together to make a bi-fold door

We ordered some plastic mirrors from a local company ([QD Plastics](http://www.qdplastics.co.uk "Q D Plastics")) which we stuck to the bifold doors with Sikaflex. The back of the doors were rebuilt using the bathroom wallboard material rather than the original wood effect. We fitted a matching cupboard door handle to the bathroom door for consistency throughout the van. 

We found the mirrors warped in heat when we holidayed in Spain, so these were later reattached inside a wooden frame so they could expand and contract. Additionally white PVC plastic was fitted around the two bifolds.

We purchased some thin wood to sandwich between wallboards to construct partition walls for the wardrobe and bathroom. The bathroom was sized to match the shower basin we recycled from the caravan and the wardrobe sized to match the available room ensuring one of the caravan cupboard doors could be used. We used thicker wood to form a more solid wall between the rear doors and the bathroom.
