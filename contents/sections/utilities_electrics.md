We did not put anywhere near enough thought into what we wanted in the van before we started wallboarding, as a result we ended up finding novel ways of hiding wires behind furniture and facings rather than behind the wallboards and ceiling boards like we should have. The following wiring diagram has evolved over time and given hindsight, should have been the first thing we did!

We planned to use the ZIG CF2000 unit recovered from the caravan to distribute power to appliances and charge the leisure battery when driving by connecting the ZIG to the leisure battery and van battery. The fridge would be wired directly to the van battery. The only wiring we planned for was the battery connections; fridge (12V and 240V); bathroom light; toilet flush; a 12v socket at the kitchen; and a single light in the centre of the van. We calculated how much wiring was required for the submersible pump and microswitch cabling would be routed along side the cold water pipes where possible through the furniture and wallboards during construction. 

We connected the ZIG to the leisure and van battery using 35A capable cabling, installing a 30A fuse for each feed. The fridge was wired directly to the van battery with 15A capable wiring with a 15A fuse. We hid fridge wiring and cabling for the bathroom light and toilet flush behind the wallboard along with cabling for the ceiling light behind the ceiling board.

We installed the 240V hookup from the caravan with a garage consumer unit to house the fuses. The 240V feed for the ZIG was connected to this consumer unit so the ZIG could charge the leisure battery and we could power the fridge directly from a 240V supply. We also installed a relay to switch the fridge on only when the alternator was providing power.

After a few years, we installed a 240V socket in the galley area. We'd considered installing a gas blow heater, but felt for the cost of purchase, we'd be better paying for electricity and using an electric heater for the times we go camping during the winter.

After a journey to Spain we realised the fridge needed some assistance, so we installed a 'Convoy' 12V thermostatically controlled cooling fan kit which required wiring to be routed after furniture had been fitted. We were able to route this through all of the kitchen unit and in front of the bathroom door by use of some edging strip where it entered the wardrobe and the wiring for the water heater control panel.

After discovering a good deal for a Solar panel, we purchased it and fitted it to the roof along with the solar regulator under the bonnet next to the leisure battery with a direct fused (7.5A) connection. The solar regulator specifically stated we shouldn't use it when another charger was running which complicated use with the van alternator.

When installing the overhead cupboards we took the opportunity to hide some more wiring for additional lights; an LED strip light in the galley area and three smaller LED lights in the dinette area. The galley light took a feed from the bathroom light wiring and the dinette was a fresh feed from the ZIG. At this point we installed a fused distribution panel to take the two 10A feeds from the ZIG and distribute them to the variety of different appliances we now had. There was a space beneath the ZIG unit which we used as a shelf for the satellite receiver and a 12V socket for both. We also installed an exterior satellite socket routing it through the facia being installed as part of the overhead cupbaords.

After a leisure battery replacement and starting to use a Shurflo pump, we decided to retire the ZIG unit and replace it with an AGU 2 way fused distribution box to feed both inputs to the existing blade fuse panel we had. We hadn't used the electric charger in some time and combined with the solar panel the need was less. The fridge mains feed was rerouted directly from the 240V consumer unit (so we can power the fridge from 240V before setting off). We then replaced the leisure battery feed with significantly larger cable, I left one of the old 35A feed cables to be used for the Fridge to reduce voltage drop and removed the van battery feed. A new 4 gauge cable (for car audio) was routed from the leisure battery to the 2 way distribution box and a new earth bolt connecting the chassis directly to the blade fuse distribution box using 4 gauge cable. The van battery was connected to the leisure battery via a split charge relay which was also used to switch off the solar panel when active. This means the leisure battery will recieve a charge from the solar panel when stationary during the day and from the alternator when moving, but never at the same time. The split charge regulator was also used to provide a 12V supply to the fridge removing the connection to the alternator.

Turns out whilst travelling in the back, a 12v socket is incredibly useful in the dinette area. We installed a temporary extension to see how much it would be used and we found we were using it at night to charge phones. So we installed a more permanent socket in the wallboard.

The TV has since been replaced with a larger one.
