The bathroom was recovered in entirety from the donor caravan. The shape and size of the LDV bathroom was dictated by the caravan's shower base. To save some space we opted to install the cartridge toilet within the shower base, this required a small cutout to be made in the shower base side to accommodate the cartridge removal. The sink would be above the toilet.

To begin with we took the bathroom door from the caravan and resized it to fit over the new bathroom door. On the first night we realised it collided with the bed out so we couldn't get into the bathroom when the bed was down! We therefore opted for a bifolding door, we sliced the door in two and ordered some plastic mirrors from a local company (Q D plastics) which we stuck to the bifold doors with Sikaflex. The back of the doors were rebuilt using the bathroom wallboard material rather than the original wood effect. We purchased new handles re place all the cupboard door handles, one was attached to the bathroom door for consistency throughout the van. We found the mirrors warped in heat when we holidayed in Spain, so these were later reattached inside a wooden frame so they could expand and contract. Additionally white PVC plastic was fitted around the two bifolds.
