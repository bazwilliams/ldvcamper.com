We recycled insulation from various sources including materials from a garage conversion and the caravan, and we purchased some acoustic material for the roof of the van, this was fitted between the braces and fiberglass roof. The van already had a plywood floor, we added a layer of rubber for additional insulation and noise proofing. Because this work was being done whilst the van was insured as a 'Panel Van', we could not cut the windows, so the wallboard was precut where the windows should be and they would be cut out of the van later.

<section name="Noise Proofing" id="noiseproofing">

We found a company called 'NoiseKiller Acoustics' which offered sound proofing kits for a variety of vans and 4x4s, we found the LDV noise loud and after reading some reviews online we opted to purchase a kit. It did make a significant improvement as we could hear each other easily when talking to someone in the back whilst driving on the motorway! Unfortunately it didn't quite fit the bonnet, presumably their template was from a different type of LDV, but it didn't take long with a pair of scissors to fit!
